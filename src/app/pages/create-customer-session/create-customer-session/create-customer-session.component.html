    A mortgage loan is a type of secured loan where you can avail funds by providing your asset as collateral to the
    lender. ... A mortgage is usually a loan sanctioned against an immovable asset like a house or a commercial
    property. The lender keeps the asset as collateral until the borrower repays the total loan amount.
